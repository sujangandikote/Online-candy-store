        Confectioner Bertha's own a small confectionery shop in the Marktgasse of Zurich's Old Town. She decide to employ a fashionable new recipe from Italy for manufacturing chocolate in solid form. Bertha, one of the most famous chocolate-makers of her day, developed a technique by which she could manufacture chocolate superior to all others of that period in aroma and melting characteristics. Bertha used the "conche" she had invented, producing chocolate with the wonderfully delivate flavor and melting quality which we know and love to this day. Her "melting chocolate" soon achieved fame, and contributed significantly to the worldwide reputation of Swiss chocolate. Bertha's deluxe is now an international conglomerate sold in more than 80 countries with eight production sites in Europe and the US, distributing on four continents (present day) - which continuing to roast our own cacao beans to produce chocolate from bean to bar.
