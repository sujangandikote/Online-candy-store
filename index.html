From chocolate gift baskets to elegant assortments and our top-selling Chocolate of the Month clubs, we’ve got you covered. And when you send fresh chocolates from Vermont, “Thank You” just sounds sweeter, “Congratulations” means more, and “Happy Birthday” takes the cake. There are more than 44 varieties of unique, hand-dipped chocolates, several flavors of creamy homemade fudge and melt-in-your-mouth peanut brittle. Most varieties are available in milk or semi-sweet chocolate. The premium chocolate Bertha uses originated with a Swiss formula and taste, above all else, is paramount. At the end of the tunnel emerge unique, individual chocolates ready for hand packing. Mass produced candy can not compare. The unsurpassed quality makes Bertha’s candy virtually fly out the door. Freshness is never an issue!
